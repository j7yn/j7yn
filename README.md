## Hi, my name is Hajin Jeong, studying computer science at the University of Waterloo! I'm currently finishing up my 2nd year, going into my 3rd.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 2 projects! 
    1. A full-stack NBA app that displays current games and statistics but with a twist - For those who like sports betting (like me) there will be a feature to predict and estimate certain        players' stats for upcoming games by training my own AI model. 
    2. A Hypixel Skyblock App (desktop and IOS) that sends notifications to the player regarding the many different events and timed deadlines within the game. Since the game has so many 
       different events and timed deadlines, it is hard to keep up with everything or remember when things are happening and where. To mitigate this, I plan on launching the mod for all of         the player base!
    

âœ¨ Check out my other projects like CC3K+ and Particle Simulation!
