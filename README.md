### About Me 👾

* I'm studying computer science at the University of Waterloo! I'm currently finishing up my 2nd year, going into my 3rd.
* I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, going to the gym, and hopelessly watching the Knicks lose


### I’m currently working on 🔨

* Frontend for my NBA Analytics Hub, a production-ready backend powered by FastAPI featuring basic NBA stats, advanced stats, player evolution, shot chart visualizations, and more!
* A MacOS version of Everything (VoidTools) - a software that can easily find files on you mac much faster than the built-in search feature in Finder
* AI/ML NBA analysis system using YOLO, OpenCV, and Python
* A graphical engine featuring Projection, Culling, Lighting, Cameras & Clipping, and Texturing & Depth
