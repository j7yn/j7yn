## Hi, my name is Hajin Jeong, studying computer science at the University of Waterloo! I'm currently finishing up my 2nd year, going into my 3rd.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack NBA app that displays current games and statistics but with a twist - For those who like sports betting (like me) there will be a feature to predict and estimate certain players' stats for upcoming games by training my own AI model, stay tuned!

âœ¨ Check out my other projects like CC3K+ and Particle Simulation!

ðŸ“« Reach me through my email: h33jeong@uwaterloo.ca or through my personal email: jhajin273@gmail.com
